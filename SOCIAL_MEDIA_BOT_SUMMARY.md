# 🤖 Social Media Bot Project Summary

## Project Overview

In response to issue #33, this repository now contains a comprehensive design for a social media container bot that will autonomously engage across multiple platforms using AI-generated content. The bot is designed as a separate project that deeply integrates with the existing Warden landing page infrastructure.

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Container-Based Deployment
```
Docker Container:
├── Node.js 20 Runtime
├── Local AI (Ollama)
├── Bot Application
├── Platform Adapters
├── Monitoring Stack
└── Database (PostgreSQL + Redis)
```

### AI Content Pipeline
```
Context Aggregation → AI Prompt Creation → Content Generation → 
Platform Adaptation → Validation → Publishing → Analytics
```
