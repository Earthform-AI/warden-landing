# Earthform AI 🌍🤖

> **Intelligence meets responsibility. Technology that honors life.**

## Our Mission

We're building AI systems that protect human life and respect our planet. Starting with **Warden** — autonomous AI-powered drones designed to shield miners in the world's most dangerous underground environments.

### The Reality Underground

Mining remains one of the most hazardous occupations worldwide:
- **28** US mining fatalities in 2024 (MSHA)
- **2.29** global TRIFR per 1M hours (ICMM 2024)

Behind every statistic is a family waiting at the kitchen table. We're not trying to replace the miner — **we're becoming their shield in the deep**.

## 🎯 Our Commitment

*"We do not take the miner's place lightly. We remember the fathers who didn't come home. We remember the cost."*

Every line of code we write, every system we design, every decision we make is guided by one principle: **protecting human life while respecting our planet**.

This is intelligent extraction, not blind consumption.  
This is Earthform.
