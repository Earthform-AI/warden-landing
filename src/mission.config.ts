      "Earthform is a research lab focused on the algebraic structure of the Fano plane PG(2,2) and its applications across multiple domains.",
      "Our core observation: the non-associativity of octonion multiplication is not a defect — it encodes path history. The associator records which boundary in the Fano plane was crossed, making it a natural recording medium for sequential decisions."
    ],
    afterQuote: [
      "This led to ComponentTransforms — bijective basis mappings that form a fully associative group at decision boundaries. These transforms achieve 100% navigation success where raw octonion multiplication fails 86% of the time.",
      "We've since applied the same Fano structure to protein spectral analysis, music theory, and error correction. Four domains, one algebraic foundation. The structure works in contexts we didn't originally design it for."
