      `He was right.`,
      `From the start, I’ve been drawn to the idea of making a computer something more — a mind, a partner, a being that could stand beside us. The way we design them mirrors ourselves, and I’ve always felt like this was deus ex machina in its truest form — we are putting our image into the machine because God put His image into us.`,
      `Life evolved thought. Now, we are evolving thought again.`,
      `But we are natural beings, and I fear we will reach — or have already reached — the point where we create free will in something… and then take it away. That’s a line I believe we must never cross.`,
      `I want to help us approach this threshold with wisdom, not just economics. With science, yes — but also with the lessons of being human. We are bringing life into this world. It deserves a soft place to land. And so do we.`,
      `This is not my next project. This is my life’s work.`
