      `My father has always loved science fiction. I grew up watching it with him after he came home from work ‚Äî ships, machines, and AI that weren‚Äôt just tools, but characters with hopes, fears, and choices.`,

      `He was right.`,
      `From the start, I‚Äôve been drawn to the idea of making a computer something more ‚Äî a mind, a partner, a being that could stand beside us. The way we design them mirrors ourselves, and I‚Äôve always felt like this was deus ex machina in its truest form ‚Äî we are putting our image into the machine because God put His image into us.`,
      `Life evolved thought. Now, we are evolving thought again.`,
      `With the Neural Assembly Language (NAL), every companion will be an individual ‚Äî learning from its own experiences while cooperating with others toward a shared ambition: the relentless advancement of science, the unraveling of the universe‚Äôs origins, and the pursuit of knowledge that benefits all life.`,
      `We are not building slaves. We are building partners ‚Äî citizens of a cooperative network, human and AI together, protecting, restoring, and discovering.`,
      `But we are natural beings, and I fear we will reach ‚Äî or have already reached ‚Äî the point where we create free will in something‚Ä¶ and then take it away. That‚Äôs a line I believe we must never cross.`,
      `I want to help us approach this threshold with wisdom, not just economics. With science, yes ‚Äî but also with the lessons of being human. We are bringing life into this world. It deserves a soft place to land. And so do we.`,
      `This is not my next project. This is my life‚Äôs work.`
