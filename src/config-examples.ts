// ===== INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THESE CONFIGS =====

/*
To update the site with any of these variations:

1. Copy the desired config object from this file
2. Replace the corresponding export in src/site.config.ts
3. Save the file - Astro will automatically reload the site
4. The changes will be reflected immediately on the website

For example, to use the alternative hero:
- Copy `heroAlternative` above  
- Paste it into site.config.ts as the `hero` export
- Replace: export const hero = { ... }
- With: export const hero = heroAlternative content

This makes it incredibly easy to test different messaging,
update content for different audiences (investors vs. technical),
or iterate based on feedback!
