Units vary by source: MSHA incidence rates are per 200,000 hours; ICMM TRIFR is per 1,000,000 hours; BLS fatal injury rates are per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers. Use care when comparing rates across sources; convert to a common basis (e.g., per 1,000,000 hours) when presenting combined charts.",
